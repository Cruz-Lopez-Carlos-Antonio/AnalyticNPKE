The present repository contains the Python codes that were developed to solve the Neutron Point Kinetics Equations, using the Laplace transform and the Heaviside's Theorem. Such solution was reported in the paper "AA new simplified analytical solution to solve the neutron point kinetics equations using the Laplace transform method", publised in the the journal of [Computer Physics Communications] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010465522002831?via%3Dihub)

Mathematical and algorithmical generalities of the codes are described in the following lines with the purpose to provide some insight of the developed work. Nevertheless, a more detailed and precise discussion is provided in the submitted article.
